# Encryption, decryption, and cracking
One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.
The Caesar Cipher is a great introduction to encryption, decryption, and code cracking, thanks to its simplicity.

#### Encrypting a message:

Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:

SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE

Here's what that might look like encrypted:

That looks an awfully lot like gobbledygook at first, but this encrypted message is actually very related to the original text.
The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.

#### Decrypting a message

According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message.

#### Frequency analysis

Human languages tend to use some letters more than others. For example, "E" is the most popular letter in the English language. We can analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely "E" and narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that.

#### Known plaintext

Another term for the original unencrypted message is plaintext. If the enemy already knew some part of the plaintext, it will be easier for them to crack the rest of the encrypted version.
For example, messages tend to start with similar beginnings. In WWII, encrypted German messages always started with a weather forecast, which ultimately made them easier for British mathematician Alan Turing to crack.

### key aspects of data encryption:

* Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).

* Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.

* Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.

## Caesar cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security.
