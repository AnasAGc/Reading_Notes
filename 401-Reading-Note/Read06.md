# How to use the Random Module in Python
We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website.

## Randint

If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

* Choice

Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

* Shuffle

The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

* Randrange

Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

# What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?

The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

## Why use Risk Analysis?

In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

what could be the possible risks that you could encounter?

1. Use of new hardware

2. Use of new technology

3. Use of new automation tool

4. The sequence of code

5. Availability of test resources for the application

### Risk Identification

There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:

* **Business Risks**: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

* **Testing Risks**: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

* **Premature Release Risk**: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

* **Software Risks**: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.

## Risk Assessment

In the risk analysis process, these steps prove to be the most important one. It is said that this step is way too complex and should be tackled with the utmost care. After risk identification, assessment has to be dealt programmatically. There are a few perspectives on risk assessment. Read on!

## How to perform Risk Analysis?

* Searching the risk

* Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

* Measures for the risk identified
