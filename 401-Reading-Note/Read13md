# How to run Linear regression in Python

You know that linear regression is a popular technique and you might as well seen the mathematical equation of linear regression. But do you know how to implement a linear regression in Python?? If so don‚Äôt read this post because this post is all about implementing linear regression in Python. There are several ways in which you can do that, you can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn. But in this post I am going to use scikit learn to perform linear regression.

Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the sklearn.linear_model module which contains ‚Äúmethods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables‚Äù.

In this post, I will use Boston Housing data set, the data set contains information about the housing values in suburbs of Boston. This dataset was originally taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University and is now available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. UCI machine learning repository contains many interesting data sets, I encourage you to go through it.

We‚Äôre living in the era of large amounts of data, powerful computers, and artificial intelligence. This is just the beginning. Data science and machine learning are driving image recognition, autonomous vehicles development, decisions in the financial and energy sectors, advances in medicine, the rise of social networks, and more. Linear regression is an important part of this.

Linear regression is one of the fundamental statistical and machine learning techniques. Whether you want to do statistics, machine learning, or scientific computing, there are good chances that you‚Äôll need it. It‚Äôs advisable to learn it first and then proceed towards more complex methods.

Regression searches for relationships among variables.

For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on the features, such as experience, level of education, role, city they work in, and so on.

This is a regression problem where data related to each employee represent one observation. The presumption is that the experience, education, role, and city are the independent features, while the salary depends on them.

Similarly, you can try to establish a mathematical dependence of the prices of houses on their areas, numbers of bedrooms, distances to the city center, and so on.

Generally, in regression analysis, you usually consider some phenomenon of interest and have a number of observations. Each observation has two or more features. Following the assumption that (at least) one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish a relation among them.

In other words, you need to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.

The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses.

The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors.

Regression problems usually have one continuous and unbounded dependent variable. The inputs, however, can be continuous, discrete, or even categorical data such as gender, nationality, brand, and so on.

It is a common practice to denote the outputs with ùë¶ and inputs with ùë•. If there are two or more independent variables, they can be represented as the vector ùê± = (ùë•‚ÇÅ, ‚Ä¶, ùë•·µ£), where ùëü is the number of inputs.

## When Do You Need Regression?

Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent the experience or gender impact salaries.

Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. For example, you could try to predict electricity consumption of a household for the next hour given the outdoor temperature, time of day, and number of residents in that household.

Regression is used in many different fields: economy, computer science, social sciences, and so on. Its importance rises every day with the availability of large amounts of data and increased awareness of the practical value of data.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. It‚Äôs among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.
