# Transforms
Its a way to size, position, and change elements it come with two different settings two-dimensional and three-dimensiona

## 2D Transforms

it work on the x and y axes 

+ 2D Rotate : provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees

+ 2D Scale : allows you to change the appeared size of an element

+ 2D Translate : pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.

+ 2D Skew : used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both

+ Perspective Depth Value : a value will set the depth of the perspective. The higher the value, the further away the perspective appears


### Transform Origin
used to change this default origin position the transform-origin property



## 3D Transforms


- 3D Rotate : to  rotate an element around any axes

- 3D Scale :  transform elements may be scaled on the z axis

- 3D Translate : to translat elements on the z axis using the translateZ value.

- 3D Skew : Skew is the one two-dimensional transform that cannot be transformed on a three-dimensional scale.

- Transform Style : The preserve-3d value allows the transformed children elements to appear in their own three-dimensional plane while the flat value forces the transformed children elements to lie flat on the two-dimensional plane.
